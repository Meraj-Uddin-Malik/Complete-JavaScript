# JavaScript Variables Practice Questions

1. **Declare a variable named `age` and assign your age to it.**  
    *Hint: Use the `let` or `const` keyword.*

2. **Change the value of the `age` variable to a new number.**  
    *Hint: Use the assignment operator `=`.*

3. **Declare a variable called `firstName` and assign your first name as a string.**  
    *Hint: Strings are written inside quotes.*

4. **Combine `firstName` and `age` into a new variable called `userInfo`.**  
    *Hint: Use the `+` operator or template literals.*

5. **What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?**  
    *Hint: Think about scope and reassignability.*

6. **Declare a constant variable called `PI` and assign it the value 3.14.**  
    *Hint: Use `const` for values that shouldn't change.*

7. **Try to reassign the value of `PI`. What happens?**  
    *Hint: Constants cannot be reassigned.*

8. **What will be the output of:**
    ```js
    var x = 5;
    let y = 10;
    const z = 15;
    x = x + y; // 5 + 10 = 15
    y = y + z; // 15 + 15 = 30
    z = z + x; // Will this work? // error
    ```
    *Hint: Think about which variables can be reassigned.*

9. **Declare a variable without assigning a value. What is its value?**  
    *Hint: Use `let` and check with `console.log`.*

10. **What is hoisting? Which variables are hoisted?**  
     *Hint: Try declaring and using variables before their declaration.*

11. **What is the output of the following code?**
     ```js
     var a = 10;
     let b = 20;
     const c = 30;
     console.log(a + b + c);
     ```
     *Hint: Think about variable scope and hoisting.*

12. **Swap the values of two variables `a` and `b`. Show the code.**  
*Hint: Use a temporary variable or array destructuring.*
