//* In JavaScript, conditional statements help your program make decisions.
//* The "if...else" statement is one of the most common conditional statements.
//* It allows you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a specified condition is true or false.

//* Truthy and Falsy Values
//* JavaScript treats some values as false when used in a condition â€” these are called falsy values.
//* The falsy values in JavaScript are: false, 0, "", null, undefined, and NaN.
//* All other values are considered truthy.

let value = 0;
if (value) {
  console.log("Truthy");
} else {
  console.log("Falsy");
}
