# Operators: 50 Interview Questions with Answers

## 1. What is an operator in programming?
An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational, or logical operations.

## 2. What are the types of operators in JavaScript?
Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, Bitwise, String, Conditional (Ternary), and Type operators.

## 3. List some arithmetic operators.
`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `++`, `--`

## 4. What does the `+` operator do?
Adds two operands or concatenates strings.

## 5. What is the difference between `==` and `===`?
`==` checks for value equality with type coercion, `===` checks for both value and type equality.

## 6. What is the modulus operator?
`%` returns the remainder after division.

## 7. What does the `++` operator do?
Increments a variable's value by 1.

## 8. What is the difference between prefix and postfix increment?
Prefix (`++a`) increments before use; postfix (`a++`) increments after use.

## 9. What is the assignment operator?
`=` assigns a value to a variable.

## 10. What does `+=` do?
Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

## 11. What is a logical operator?
Operators like `&&`, `||`, and `!` used to combine or invert boolean values.

## 12. What does `&&` do?
Returns true if both operands are true.

## 13. What does `||` do?
Returns true if at least one operand is true.

## 14. What does `!` do?
Inverts the boolean value.

## 15. What is a comparison operator?
Operators that compare two values, e.g., `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.

## 16. What does `!=` do?
Checks if two values are not equal (with type coercion).

## 17. What does `!==` do?
Checks if two values are not equal or not of the same type.

## 18. What is the ternary operator?
A shorthand for `if-else`: `condition ? expr1 : expr2`.

## 19. What is a bitwise operator?
Operators that work on binary representations: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`.

## 20. What does `&` do?
Bitwise AND.

## 21. What does `|` do?
Bitwise OR.

## 22. What does `^` do?
Bitwise XOR.

## 23. What does `~` do?
Bitwise NOT (inverts bits).

## 24. What does `<<` do?
Left shift.

## 25. What does `>>` do?
Right shift.

## 26. What does `>>>` do?
Zero-fill right shift.

## 27. What is the typeof operator?
Returns the type of a variable.

## 28. What does `instanceof` do?
Checks if an object is an instance of a constructor.

## 29. What is the difference between `typeof null` and `typeof undefined`?
`typeof null` is `"object"`, `typeof undefined` is `"undefined"`.

## 30. What is operator precedence?
The order in which operators are evaluated.

## 31. What is operator associativity?
The direction in which an expression is evaluated when operators have the same precedence.

## 32. What is short-circuit evaluation?
Logical operators (`&&`, `||`) stop evaluating as soon as the result is determined.

## 33. What is the comma operator?
Evaluates multiple expressions and returns the last one.

## 34. What does the spread operator `...` do?
Expands iterable elements into individual elements.

## 35. What does the rest operator `...` do?
Collects multiple elements into an array.

## 36. What is the difference between `==` and `!=`?
`==` checks for equality, `!=` checks for inequality (both with type coercion).

## 37. What is the difference between `===` and `!==`?
`===` checks for strict equality, `!==` checks for strict inequality.

## 38. What is the nullish coalescing operator `??`?
Returns the right operand if the left is `null` or `undefined`.

## 39. What is the optional chaining operator `?.`?
Safely accesses nested object properties.

## 40. What does the `delete` operator do?
Removes a property from an object.

## 41. What does the `in` operator do?
Checks if a property exists in an object.

## 42. What is the `void` operator?
Evaluates an expression and returns `undefined`.

## 43. What is the `new` operator?
Creates an instance of an object.

## 44. What is the `typeof` operator's result for arrays?
`"object"`

## 45. What is the result of `2 + "2"`?
`"22"` (string concatenation)

## 46. What is the result of `"5" - 2`?
`3` (string is coerced to number)

## 47. What is the result of `true + false`?
`1` (`true` is 1, `false` is 0)

## 48. What is the result of `null == undefined`?
`true`

## 49. What is the result of `null === undefined`?
`false`

## 50. What is the result of `NaN === NaN`?
`false`
