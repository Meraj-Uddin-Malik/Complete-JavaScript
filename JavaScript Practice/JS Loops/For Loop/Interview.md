# JavaScript For Loop: 50 Interview Questions & Answers

---

### 1. What is a `for` loop in JavaScript?
A `for` loop is a control structure that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition.

---

### 2. What is the syntax of a `for` loop?
```js
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // code block
}
```

---

### 3. How many times will the following loop run?
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```
**Answer:** 5 times (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

---

### 4. Can you omit any parts of the `for` loop?
Yes, initialization, condition, and increment can be omitted, but semicolons are required.

---

### 5. What happens if the condition is always true?
The loop becomes infinite unless a `break` statement is used.

---

### 6. How do you break out of a `for` loop?
Use the `break` statement.

---

### 7. How do you skip an iteration in a `for` loop?
Use the `continue` statement.

---

### 8. What will this output?
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    if (i === 1) continue;
    console.log(i);
}
```
**Answer:** 0, 2

---

### 9. Can you nest `for` loops?
Yes, you can place one `for` loop inside another.

---

### 10. What is the scope of the variable declared with `let` in a `for` loop?
It is block-scoped to the loop.

---

### 11. What is the difference between `var` and `let` in a `for` loop?
`var` is function-scoped; `let` is block-scoped.

---

### 12. How do you loop backwards?
```js
for (let i = 5; i > 0; i--) {
    // code
}
```

---

### 13. How do you loop through an array using a `for` loop?
```js
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // arr[i]
}
```

---

### 14. What is the output?
```js
for (;;) {
    break;
    console.log("Hello");
}
```
**Answer:** Nothing is printed.

---

### 15. How do you use a `for` loop to sum numbers 1 to 10?
```js
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    sum += i;
}
```

---

### 16. Can you use `for` loops with objects?
Not directly; use `for...in` or `Object.keys()` with a `for` loop.

---

### 17. What is the difference between `for`, `for...in`, and `for...of`?
- `for`: traditional, uses index.
- `for...in`: iterates over object keys.
- `for...of`: iterates over iterable values.

---

### 18. How do you exit both inner and outer loops?
Use a labeled `break`.

---

### 19. What is a labeled statement in a `for` loop?
A label allows you to break/continue a specific loop.

---

### 20. Example of labeled break:
```js
outer: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        if (j === 1) break outer;
    }
}
```

---

### 21. Can you use `for` loops with strings?
Yes, by iterating over string indices.

---

### 22. How do you reverse an array using a `for` loop?
```js
let reversed = [];
for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    reversed.push(arr[i]);
}
```

---

### 23. What is the time complexity of a simple `for` loop?
O(n), where n is the number of iterations.

---

### 24. Can you modify the loop variable inside the loop?
Yes, but it can lead to unexpected results.

---

### 25. What happens if you forget to increment the loop variable?
The loop may become infinite.

---

### 26. How do you loop through a 2D array?
Nested `for` loops.

---

### 27. How do you break only the inner loop in nested loops?
Use `break` without a label.

---

### 28. Can you use `for` loops with asynchronous code?
Not directly; use `async/await` carefully.

---

### 29. How do you create an infinite loop?
```js
for (;;) {
    // infinite
}
```

---

### 30. How do you loop with a step of 2?
```js
for (let i = 0; i < n; i += 2) {
    // code
}
```

---

### 31. How do you loop over an array in reverse?
```js
for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    // arr[i]
}
```

---

### 32. How do you use `for` loop to filter values?
By using `if` inside the loop.

---

### 33. How do you use `for` loop to find a value?
Use `if` and `break` when found.

---

### 34. How do you use `for` loop to count occurrences?
Increment a counter inside the loop.

---

### 35. How do you use `for` loop to copy an array?
```js
let copy = [];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    copy.push(arr[i]);
}
```

---

### 36. How do you use `for` loop to flatten a 2D array?
Nested loops, push elements to a new array.

---

### 37. How do you use `for` loop to generate a sequence?
Push values to an array inside the loop.

---

### 38. How do you use `for` loop to print a pattern?
Use nested loops for rows and columns.

---

### 39. How do you use `for` loop to remove elements from an array?
Use `splice` inside the loop, iterate backwards.

---

### 40. How do you use `for` loop to update array elements?
Assign new values inside the loop.

---

### 41. How do you use `for` loop with `break` and `continue` together?
Use `continue` to skip, `break` to exit.

---

### 42. How do you use `for` loop to find the maximum value?
Compare and store the max value inside the loop.

---

### 43. How do you use `for` loop to find the minimum value?
Compare and store the min value inside the loop.

---

### 44. How do you use `for` loop to sum even numbers?
Check `if (i % 2 === 0)` inside the loop.

---

### 45. How do you use `for` loop to sum odd numbers?
Check `if (i % 2 !== 0)` inside the loop.

---

### 46. How do you use `for` loop to concatenate strings?
Append strings inside the loop.

---

### 47. How do you use `for` loop to count vowels in a string?
Check each character inside the loop.

---

### 48. How do you use `for` loop to reverse a string?
Iterate backwards, build a new string.

---

### 49. How do you use `for` loop to check for palindromes?
Compare characters from start and end.

---

### 50. How do you use `for` loop to generate multiplication tables?
Nested loops for rows and columns.
