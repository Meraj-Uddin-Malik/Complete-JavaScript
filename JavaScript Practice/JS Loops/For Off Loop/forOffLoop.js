  `A for...of loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, and sets. It gives you the values directly, not the keys or indices`
);

// Syntax Example:
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"];
for (let fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit); // Outputs each fruit in the array
}
// The loop iterates over each element in the `fruits` array, allowing you to access the values directly.

console.log("Practice Questions for For...Of Loops");

// 1. Create an array of numbers and use a for...of loop to print each number.
// Hint: Define an array with at least five numbers and iterate through it.

// 2. Write a for...of loop to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.
// Hint: Initialize a sum variable and add each element to it during the loop.

// 3. Create a string and use a for...of loop to print each character.
// Hint: Define a string and iterate through it to access each character.

// 4. Write a function that takes an array of strings and returns a new array with all strings converted to uppercase using a for...of loop.
// Hint: Initialize an empty array and push each uppercase string into it during the loop.

// 5. Create an array of objects (e.g., books with title and author). Use a for...of loop to print each book's title and author.
// Hint: Define an array of objects and iterate through it to access properties.

// 6. Write a for...of loop to find the longest string in an array of strings.
// Hint: Initialize a variable to keep track of the longest string and compare lengths during the loop

// 7. Create an array of mixed data types (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans). Use a for...of loop to print the type of each element.
// Hint: Use the typeof operator inside the loop to determine the type of each element.

// 8. Write a function that takes an iterable (like a Set) and returns an array of its values using a for...of loop.
// Hint: Initialize an empty array and push each value into it during the loop.

// 9. Create an array of numbers and use a for...of loop to find the maximum number.
// Hint: Initialize a max variable with the first element and compare it with each element during the loop.

// 10. Write a for...of loop to create a new array that only includes even numbers from an existing array of numbers.
// Hint: Initialize an empty array and check if each number is even before adding it to the new array.
