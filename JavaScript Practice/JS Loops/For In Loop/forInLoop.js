  `A for...in loop in JavaScript is used to iterate over the enumerable properties (keys) of an object. \n`
);

// Syntax Example:
// const person = {
//     name: "Alice",
//     age: 25,
//     city: "Delhi"
//     };
// for (let key in person) {
//   console.log(key + ": " + person[key]); // Outputs each key-value pair
// }
// The loop iterates over each property in the `person` object, allowing you to access both the keys and their corresponding values.

console.log("Practice Questions for For...In Loops \n");

// 1. Create an object representing a car with properties like make, model, and year. Use a for...in loop to print each property and its value.
// Hint: Define an object with at least three properties and iterate through it.

// 2. Write a for...in loop to count the number of properties in an object.
// Hint: Initialize a counter variable and increment it for each property in the object.

// 3. Create an object with nested objects (e.g., a person with address details). Use a for...in loop to print all properties, including nested ones.
// Hint: Use nested for...in loops to access properties of nested objects.

// 4. Write a function that takes an object as an argument and returns an array of its keys using a for...in loop.
// Hint: Initialize an empty array and push each key into it during the loop.

// 5. Create an object representing a shopping cart with items and their prices. Use a for...in loop to calculate the total price of all items.
// Hint: Initialize a total variable and add each item's price to it during the loop.

// 6. Write a for...in loop to find the longest property name in an object.
// Hint: Initialize a variable to keep track of the longest name and compare lengths during the loop.

// 7. Create an object with boolean properties (e.g., isAvailable, isActive). Use a for...in loop to print only the properties that are true.
// Hint: Use an if statement inside the loop to check the value of each property.

// 8. Write a function that takes an object and returns a new object with all string properties converted to uppercase using a for...in loop.
// Hint: Create a new object and assign uppercase values to it during the loop.

// 9. Create an object with various data types (string, number, array). Use a for...in loop to print the type of each property.
// Hint: Use the typeof operator inside the loop to determine the type of each property.

// 10. Write a for...in loop to create a new object that only includes properties with numeric values from an existing object.
// Hint: Initialize a new object and check the type of each property before adding it to the new object.
