console.log("Practice Questions for While Loops");

// 1. Write a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
// Hint: Initialize a counter variable and use it in the loop condition.

// 2. Create a while loop that counts down from 10 to 1 and prints each number.
// Hint: Use a decrementing counter variable.

// 3. Write a while loop that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100.
// Hint: Initialize a sum variable and check if each number is even before adding it.

// 4. Create a while loop that prints the multiplication table of 5 (from 5 to 50).
// Hint: Use a counter variable to multiply by 5 and print the result.

// 5. Write a while loop that continues until a user inputs "exit". Use prompt to get user input.
// Hint: Use a loop that checks the input and breaks when "exit" is entered.

// 6. Create a while loop that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to 100.
// Hint: Use two variables to keep track of the last two numbers in the sequence.

// 7. Write a while loop that finds the first 10 prime numbers.
// Hint: Use a function to check if a number is prime and increment a counter for found primes.

// 8. Create a while loop that prints the factorial of a number (e.g., 5!).
// Hint: Use a variable to keep track of the factorial and multiply it in each iteration.

// 9. Write a while loop that reverses a string.
// Hint: Use a variable to build the reversed string character by character.

// 10. Create a while loop that generates random numbers between 1 and 50 until a number greater than 40 is generated.
// Hint: Use Math.random() to generate numbers and check if they are greater than 40
